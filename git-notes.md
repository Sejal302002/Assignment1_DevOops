# \# Git Fetch vs. Git Pull

# 

# \## git fetch

# `git fetch` downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local working branch. It updates your remote-tracking branches (like `origin/main`). This is useful when you want to see what others have been working on without immediately integrating their changes into your local branch.

# 

# \## git pull

# `git pull` is a combination of two commands: `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. It fetches the latest changes from the remote and immediately tries to merge them into your current local branch. It is a more direct way to get your branch up-to-date with the remote.
